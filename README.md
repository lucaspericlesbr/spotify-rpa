<!-- About The Project -->
## ðŸš€ About The Project

This is a complete automation project using the Robot Framework. The goal is to automate tests on web, desktop, and mobile applications. For web applications, we use Selenium WebDriver and for desktop applications, we use the Sikuli library. For mobile applications, we use Appium.

This project is an example of how it's possible to use the Robot Framework to automate tests on different platforms, increasing the efficiency and quality of an application's tests.
